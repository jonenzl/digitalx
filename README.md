# digitalx
I created the DigitalX e-commerce web application as the final project for my development course.

DigitalX is a shop for music, movies, and video games in Auckland. The old website of DigitalX was developed using PHP and only supports static HTML web. The website needed to be upgraded to an e-commerce website using .NET Framework and related technologies (ASP.NET, WCF, SQL Server).

The new website provides online-shopping functionalities for all registered customers. All data related to the business operation is saved to the database safely.

This project consists of a Visual Studio solution with three projects. These three projects are ClassLibrary, WcfDigitalX, and DigitalX.
